The brief from the client was two-fold and simple: to lift the original beauty of the site and for the atmosphere to be representative of the beauty of comfort.

The unavoidable need for equipment and an ergonomic work space needed to blend in the 19th century architectural features and painted ceilings.

In parallel it was necessary that the clientele is looked after with high tech treatments and the highest level of professionalism...

Taken in its holistic sense and translating it into a design concept it meant eliminating jarriness. Nothing stands out so that everything stands out.

The unavoidable need for equipment and an ergonomic work space needed to blend in the 19th century architectural features and painted ceilings. 

In parallel it is necessary that the clientele is looked after with high tech treatments and the highest level of professionalism, which needed to marry an utmost feeling of comfort and relaxation.

Taken in its holistic sense and translating it into a design concept it meant eliminating jarriness. Nothing stands out so that everything stands out.

Elements balance off one another to be background and hero of one another.
The original features of the building did half the job, and were starting point to the design process. Everything else in those main reception rooms has a soft minimalistic language where monolithic geometries made comfortable to sight and touch by the materials chosen. These house all the practical elements of the salon, leaving the beauty of the building untouched and able to stand alone.

A general feeling of homeliness needed to reconcile seamlessly with the experience of being the only one that matters.

Each styling station with precious gold leaf and marble details defines the clients' own private space by being hidden inside the monolithic built in joinery. The armchair and side tables were carefully selected to convey that very easy comfort of a relaxed living room.

Similarly the medical treating rooms have a luxurious private dressing room feel to convey comfort.
